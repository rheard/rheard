# Hello, Mars!

I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a strong interest in Python, algorithmic puzzles, game modding, and contributing to the open-source community.

## üå± Areas of Interest
* Solving complex algorithmic problems, like the magic square of squares problem.
* Continuously contributing to open-source projects like Django.
* Exploring how to use Python with other technologies like C-acceleration or C# integration.
* Reverse engineering video games.
* Buzzword(s): AI-generated content, quantum, ...

## üìö Important Repositories
* [Project Euler](https://github.com/rheard/ProjectEuler): My attempts at solving Project Euler problems.
* [Magic Square of Squares](https://github.com/rheard/magic_sq): A solution for the magic square of squares problem using Python and C++.
* [Python NetForms](https://github.com/rheard/pynetforms): A Pythonic library for using NetForms.
* [Python Net GUI Automation](https://github.com/rheard/pynetauto): A Pythonic library for using C# GUI Automation libraries.
* [Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/rheard/Sudoku_Solver): An old college project, a simple script for solving sudoku puzzles quickly.
* [CUDA BigInteger](https://github.com/rheard/BigInteger-for-CUDA): My attempt at implementing a BigInteger solution that would support CUDA. I would not recommend anyone try to use this.

### üè∫ Ancient Repositories

While these are important repositories, this is work that I haven't touched since high-school and are more useful as archives.
